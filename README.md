# Voice Equalizer üó£Ô∏èüéõÔ∏è

A light-weight, real-time microphone equalizer written in Python that you can route into OBS, Discord, Zoom, etc.

I made this during this livestream: https://x.com/omarish/status/1931409094910357539

## Why?

* Audio quality can be the difference between a good and a great livestream.
* There are things we can control, and things we can't control.
* This lets you tune and run a live equalizer on your audio streams.

## Default Preset

The default preset focuses on:

* A gentle low-end boost for broadcast warmth
* Clean removal of 60 Hz mains hum
* Presence bump around 3 kHz so mechanical keyboard clicks sound crisp
* High-pass + low-pass to keep HVAC rumble and bird chirps out
* A simple noise-gate that mutes the mic when you are silent

Feel free to tweak the filter design in `voice_equalizer/processing.py ‚Üí design_eq()`.

During the **tune** workflow you can now set custom Gain (dB) and Bandwidth **Q** for every detected band right in the terminal.

## Quick start

1. **Install [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** (if you haven't already):

```bash
brew install uv # macOS
```

2. **Create a virtual env & install deps** (all *via* UV):

```bash
uv venv .venv
uv pip -p .venv/bin/python install -e .
# optional, activate for shell convenience
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. **List your audio devices** (optional):

```bash
python -m sounddevice
```

4. **Run the equalizer** (substitute device names or indices as needed):

```bash
python -m voice_equalizer --input "Built-in Microphone" --output "BlackHole 2ch"
```

## Customisation

* Change sample-rate & latency: `--samplerate 44100 --frames 512`
* Modify the EQ bands inside `design_eq()` ‚Äì each stage is a regular SciPy IIR filter expressed as *second-order sections*.
* Adjust the noise-gate threshold in `_process()` (`-45 dBFS` by default).
